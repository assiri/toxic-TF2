97f54078ce82c13a,yes and no  the original concept for multics was to have commands execute as separate subsidiary processes  a la unix however  multics processes turned out to be rather expensive  computationally and so the plan was changed to make them  subroutines  called from the command interpreter the ability of multics to dynamically link to a subroutine in any  file  in the filesystem was a key thing in making this work you could compile a new command  and then try it out right away  without having to link up a new version of the command interpreter multics did always have the ability for anyone to start a subsidiary process  but it just wasn t used much  talk ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

f6e997cabfc43932, pictures and copyright hey i really appreciate the excellent work you have done expanding cuisine of cambodia  the article looks much better now than it did a couple of weeks ago  i just wanted to tell you a couple of things  the beautiful image of num bachok  that you have been trying to add to the article is taken from this site if you look at the bottom of that page  you can see the the website is copyright  this means that wikipedia cannot use the image in the encyclopedia without getting in trouble  if you have a picture of num bachok that you have taken and would like to allow wikipedia to use freely you can upload it here then see wikipedia picture tutorial for instructions on how to add your image to the article the second thing is that i ve edited out two lines from the article about people in phnom penh  your text said many of the khmers who knew how to cook authentic khmer cuisine before the civil war were killed during the khmer rouge regime  very few cambodians know how to cook real khmer cuisine  if you visit phnom penh today  the khmer  food  now tastes more like thai because the people of phnom penh came from refugee camps so did not know the real features of authentic of khmer cuisine  the first part maybe true because so many people were killed during the kr regime  however  the next two lines are only an opinion  and probably not true  so  i have removed them  if you can find a reliable source that says those things then you should add the text back to the article with a reference to the source thanks again for expanding the article with so much good information about tasty khmer food i love it too  ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

c7fe29cd47bfb599, midway turning point in my view  if there was a turning point in the war on japan  midway has to be it  while the japanese had been stopped at coral sea  they still had the initiative  they could still choose where and when to attack  and the allies had to react  but not after midway  it was  after all  they that launched the midway aleutians operation  and they that were then rocked back on their heels  and they that fled afterward  it was they that had lost of their big  fast carriers  and the carrier was to the war in the pacific what the ballistic missile was to the cold war  somewhere above someone argues that the remainder of the japanese fleet was still a formidable force  but that is nonsense  all that force could do would be to sail out and get sunk by a carrier equipped us navy far from being merely a tactical victory  it changed the whole complexion of the war  now  while they did attempt some more offensive action  notably by trying to take port moresby  again  this time over land via the kokoda trail in the  nd half of this was all relatively minor  designed to strengthen their defensive positions not to conquer  and was  ultimately almost all unsuccessful  they never again tried the kind of massive  seaborne  combined arms operation that had swept them across most of the pacific in a just a few months  then just months after midway the us landed on guadalcanal  and clearly the initiative was ours  and japan was in defensive mode  thus the guadalcanal campaign can t be considered the actual turning point either by then the us was clearly on the attack i don t think the argument that there is no turning point because japan could never have ultimately  won  the pacific war works out either  japanese planners did know that they could not win a long war militarily but that was not their plan  strategically their plans went something like start the war from as superior a position as possible  hence pearl harbor race across the pacific  seizing resources and territory before the us could gear up for war attain as defensible a position as possible  hence the kokoda trail offensive and takeover of the solomons  and dig in let the us grind itself down against near impregnable fortresses win a favorable peace settlement when the us tires itself out throwing itself against their defenses but they failed at when they didn t sink the us carriers at pearl harbor  and only months later midway signalled the early end of by the failure to take port moresby  they also failed at part of they had some hope to succeed at when the bloody costs of both tarawa and buna gona became known  us public opinion was shaken  even as late as many americans found the though of the casualties invading japan would cost to be appalling so  my conclusion is that midway was  the  turning point in the pacific  i realize this whole idea of a turning point is rather subjective  but i really think if there was one in the south pacific  it has to be midway  ferrocephalus  talk ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

c9292dddab6e1aba,  sorry to resurrect this issue after a very long while  however  the example of rice perfectly illustrates my point  the current abdul halim is a name page  analagous to rice  surname as such it is a perfectly good page  however  in creating it you have removed the necessary and separate page which disambiguates between uses of the term abdul halim analagous to rice  disambiguation abdul halim  disambiguation  is currently a redirect to abdul halim  which is not a disambiguation page as it does not follow the disambiguation guidelines i referred to above  also  by placing the name page at abdul halim  you give it the status of primary topic  it is more likely that one of the other uses should be there  or it should be the disambiguation page  i suggest you correct your edits to be in line with current guidelines by moving the current abdul halim to abdul halim  name  and creating a new disambiguation page at abdul halim  following the guidelines at wp d and mos d  you will need to do this for any other names you treated in this way  thank you  ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
be6a675e060fb17a,  i moved the markham and dixie championships from the central b mid ontario to the metro league  where they played dixie beehives perhaps the first team to operate in the oha under the dixie name was the dixie staffords of the pre metro junior  b  grouping that operated during the season  in the east york rockets of the metro grouping moved to become the dixie rockets  a few years later  the team changed its name to the dixie beehives  the metro junior  b  hockey league was a strong league and the beehives were the league s most stable team  in a new tier ii junior  a  provincial league was formed and the dixie beehives were one of six metro teams to move up to the new league  the beehives played in the league until when they ceased operations  the league managed to last only one additional season patey  larry hockey born  march toronto  ontario lary patey played most of his young career in mississauga  first in the port credit hockey association and later with the metro junior b dixie beehives  it was with the beehives in march of that patey suffered a near fatal accident during the metro junior b final against the markham waxers that dixie would eventually go on to win in five games hammered into the boards by foot defenceman bob dailey  patsey slumped to the ice  while trying to get up  patsey s teammate rick cornacchia took on dailey in a tussle and the ensuing melee  patey was caught in the face by a skate blade  from that horrific evening  patey went on to a long and successful year national hockey league career as a centreman  after leading the western league in scoring while with sault lake city golden eagles where captured rookie of the year honors  patey was soon called up to the now defunct california golden seals  later  patey was traded to the st  louis blues in for wayne merrick and he concluded his career with new york rangers before having to retire because of lower back injury a workaholic on the ice throughout his career  patey later applied the same hard work ethic in the world of real estate and earned president s club honors as one of the gundaker better homes and gardens in st  louis after only being in the business for four years while patey had his most productive season offensively for california in when he scored goals to go along with assists  it was during his stay with the blues that the seventh round draft choice drew the most attention for his strong two way play  st  louis didn t care how many goals i scored  they had red berenson  derek sanderson and gary unger up front to do that  they wanted me to play defensively and aggressively  patey combined both skills to set a st  louis club record for most shorthanded goals in a season and was always called on to line up against the bryan trottiers  bobby clarkes and phil espositos of the nhl  i enjoyed doing it because there was less pressure in having to score goals and i took a lot of pride in my role  living the life as a shadow  patey did manage to score goals in his year professional career before retiring after the season while the league s fans didn t always notice patey  or the fine job he did in shutting down opponents  his peers throughout the league certainly did  ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

096dc1155bf15c64, what i dislike about your proposed version is that it doesn t carry the forms aspects distinction which was the point of my proposal  i think it s extremely important to have this distinction in mind  a  if we re going to keep political liberalism in there  we need to call it an aspect because no liberal objects to what s been called political liberalism here  so it doesn t exactly make sense to call it a form of liberalism which people argue over  b  the reason i insist on this is that modern political ideologies borrow certain aspects of liberal thought  and then abandon others  the aspects division gives people the power to understand the influence of the liberal tradition by comparing it to other ideologies with these categories in mind  the perfect example is that of social conservatives who  can be  economically liberal without being socially liberal  in any case  if the forms aspects division is tossed  then i d rather that those sections called cultural and political liberalism also be removed  or placed in a different section  since they already describe essential noncontroversial issues within liberalism  iirc the only paragraph i ommitted was the last one about modern day liberalism lip service  since it was already discussed earlier in the section  and seemed out of place given the topic of this section the other sections were shuffled around to one place or another  ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

e8f068347bc0f9de,how was this possible i have a question which the article does not cover  how does someone whos is blind and deaf learn to read and write in several languages and accomplish all the things she did  think about it  you cannot see or hear anything and were not able to since you were a baby  how could she possibly understand anything about the world at all  the text just states that her teachers taught her what things were and the daughter of the cook used sign language to speak to her  how is this possible  how could someone use sign language when keller could not see the sign in the first place  how would she know what human beings are  let alone complex things like nation states or socialism  it just does not seem possible  the article only states that someone taught her things  but how  i am not buying it ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

95aeaf5a2bef84d8,there are plenty of sources which are not age old and i have provided them before considering i used to take part in actual discussion on discussion pages until direktor would then find a way to limit that discussion in that the discussion page is  not a forum he is against any academic progress and democracy in general  stating such is  of course  an attack on his character even though he openly worships communist totalitarian regimes here on wikipedia and communist totalitarian dictatorships and dictators  even when there is vast consensus against him  since he is paid to be here  he knows every possible way to limit such exposure and simply logs complaints against the opposition until they are completely outlawed and banned  typically this type of behavior is traditional in communist totalitarian dictatorships  my comment was of course a legitimate content comment as all content is monitored and approved by direktor and his lobby group here on wikipedia  unless you have something negative to add don t add it at all because he will have it removed  this is because this topic in itself is still political in modern day croatia where any type of objective historical discussion is branded as communist revisionism as outlined by one dr  ante birin at the croatian historic institute who recently held a great discussion on the matter  i would like to point out that the user direktor has directly linked me to nazi sm even though anyone with half a brain knows that german national socialism is not the same as croatian ustasism but of course  that is not an attack on my personal character  i have not been  block  for any relevant reason other than the fact that i oppose direktors nonacademic claim to all ww  croatia related articles  some of my statements were in hope that someone would notice his bias which is the biggest elephant i have ever seen standing in a room ever  regarding dr  pavelic s nationality pavelic did not believe in yugoslavism  he was a self declared anti yugoslav and on many occasions publicly  and in written form argued the idiot  ic basis of such a movement  but of course it only makes sense to have pavelic be a yugoslav so that tito can be considered a croat in direktors logical political platform here on wikipedia  thank you ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
c42efac20db18753, the statement below quoted from user satellite geometry seems to be incompatible with the navigation equations the time for receiver clocks is synchronized with the satellite clocks as a part of the solution process it is certainly true that the receiver location is at the intersection of spheres since it is at the intersection of n spheres where n is greater than it is sometimes incorrectly said that the user location is at the intersection of three spheres  while simpler to visualize  this is only the case if the receiver has a clock synchronized with the satellite clocks  i e the receiver measures true ranges to the satellites rather than range differences there are significant performance benefits to the user carrying a clock synchronized with the satellites  foremost is that only three satellites are needed to compute a position solution  if this were part of the gps system concept so that all users needed to carry a synchronized clock  then a smaller number of satellites could be deployed  however  the cost and complexity of the user equipment would increase significantly  licensed professional engineer ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

6ff533552215bfe4, i am not a legal expert  but trying to put too much detail in the legal section will be difficult since only actual court cases in each jurisdiction will decide whether bitcoin is illegal in that jurisdiction or not  for example  it is stated above the claim that bitcoin is illegal in indonesia is based on the warning of the bank indonesia  which claimed that bitcoin is not a legal medium of exchange in indonesia thus  bitcoin is legal as long as you do not use it as a medium of exchange  you can thus legally mine it and legally buy it outside indonesia and hoard it in the country  it is legal  as long as you do not use it as a medium of exchange  similarly  intricate and complicated legal arguments can most probably be made for all statements regarding the legality of bitcoin in each jurisdiction in the world  this article is clearly not the space to get bogged down in these legal matters  perhaps this should be stated as a preamble to this section  obviously referencing newspaper articles about the legality or not of bitcoin in a country may be encyclopedic  but may be far from correct in terms of the actual legal status in a jurisdiction  most probably not many courtcases regarding this matter have been decided by now  the correct way would be to only allow references to courtcases deciding these legal matters in each jurisdiction  ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

333880408850e5a0,so you find that a right wing and left wing unreliable source agree and assume they must both be correct there has been considerable study of marx and there is no reason that we need to use popular books as sources the only reason one would use them is that they contain claims that have not been accepted by mainstream historians also  they lead us into discussions about what really happened which is a misuse of other editors  time we have an unsubstantiated claim by jenny marx made years after the event that her husband provided money for workers to buy weapons we do not by the way have any reliable sources that these workers obtained or used weapons in belgium in reliable sources state that the french government supplied unemployed belgian workers with weapons in paris and these workers then returned to belgium in an attempt to overthrow the government we know that marx was arrested on suspicion of carrying arms and was ejected from the country  but in fact the accusation was false the types of additional sources that martintg has provided are unreliable boris nicolaevsky for example was a communist activist  writing in not a mainstream historian wheen and muravchick are neoconservatives writing outside the academic mainstream we just do not know what marx did with the francs he received ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

0d0e5b1d08f5fa0e,  may utc as far as i know it has been stated that several universes do not fit into the actual accepted universe of wold newton which integrates with the dc comics universe thanks to alan moore  thus marvel only corresponds to the universe due to the cross over connections or with the exception of steven rogers and peter parker whose worlds do not clash with the dc universe chronology  as for star wars it is speculated that it could be linked to the wold newton universe  only star wars takes place in an entirely different future past element  basically a universe that predates that of the earth  and tolkien s universe is also out of context due to the complex mythology that has no links outside of its realm  the same applies to dungeons dragons  world of warcraft and warhammer  however the world of faeries is related thanks to king arthur and shakespeare as well as c s  lewis and hans christian anderson brothers grimm  harry potter s world also doesn t tie in to the wold newton as far as i have seen  and as for looney tunes and disney the only way they might tie in is through who framed roger rabbit which has as of yet to be linked  of course this is still a lot of debate as to what fits in and what doesn t  the only reason i added the list was to inform the reader as to why the characters from those universes or worlds were not present  perhaps it could be stated that although they are not accepted within the universe it is yet to be seen whether or not they are truly acknowledged as being apart from it as a whole  piecraft ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

088f05da90bebada, that helped a lot  thanks  the thing is most of the media sources in india often considered the criteria for wp rs  neither present an event in its complete terms nor is there a neutral perspective ever if any  a lot of issues and persons have been badly attacked by almost every section of the mainstream media  and it is so extremely rare to hit upon a site that gives some fair perspective or the other side of the coin but then they are not generally regarded in front of what the usual sources like the hindu or the toi which omits to cover certain parts of india and most of what is published is highly opinionated  the other day  content based on a fairly reasonable source was removed and this was hugely absurd since none of other mainstream media even covered the tamil nadu elections at a length  except for announcing the winning coalition nothing much in fact nothing at all  is mentioned of this person and his campaigning that brought about the fall of the ruling alliance  at the moment  various youtube channels and small scale news agencies that probably don t even own a website of their own  are the only bearers of pieces of information and its bloody unbelievable that i am the first wikipedian trying to get all these into wikipedia  excluding this personality  there are several others more who are making significant popular impact  but are nowhere to be found in wikipedia  its more pitiful that the already experienced and active indian wikipedians are not giving a damn either  it only brings editors like me to the suspicion that the existing chaps are perhaps too opinionated and biased to ignore true and essential information coming out  and worse still they are the first to sponsor support opposition towards others who try to step in for the sake by bringing wp rs every time  thousands of other articles meanwhile  present heck loads of falsehood and bulls it  i am not using that as an excuse  but you know  its just surprising and suspicious  the extent of controversy that is inflicted on a select few articles  as a relative newbie  i find its tough to resist intimidation and not crumble at the same time  thanks for your reply  it was very informative  and i am glad i was worth all that talk contr mail ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

8eb640ff8a12d653,question about guardian angels according to the wiki article on demonology  there are demons and the bible says of the angels fell from heaven and became demons therefore  this would mean that there are good angels  i e total good and bad angels with the bad angels being of given that there are about billion people on the earth currently  this would mean that a guardian angel would have to have more than one person he she it is responsible for  i assume that god would not assign someone a demon to be his her guardian angel  so this makes the number of possible guardian angels at maximum since the world population is now this would mean that each guardian angel would have to be assigned to people does the above really sound reasonable to you guys also  what did those million guardian angels do when there was less than million people on the earth the world population reached million around the year or so ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

a8719d03df5573a7, hi micky  hey  not sure if my last message went out or not  my system sort of froze up for a bit and i could not log back on for a bit the gist of what i typed folows not intending to be a smart aleck but the seal  as opposed to the coat of arms doesn t appear in color officially  i think deb markowitz  secreatary of stae for vermont would back up that it is a single color device  i really do like the seal  it was deisgned by ira allen  and is refreshingly differnet from most others  perhaps a trifle na  ve in design but a nice device  it was designed to have dies cut for embossing so it is high contrast line art not showing shafiding or multiple colors  if you take a look at the staes of maine  california  michigan  you note more of a full color with shading and dpeth sort of treatment  these though labled seals are all heraldically like a coat of arms  if we look at nations  like the netherlands  uk  canda  we see coats of arms  american civic heraldry is different  vermont like many of our older east coast states has a coat of arms that is described by a statute  what can be called a blazon  because vermont s coat of arms is so great i would love to see it used somewhere  maybe as an illustration on the vermont page  and as its own entry  if the word seal in the sidebar is boiler plate and can not be changed to coat of arms  could we use a solis dark green or medium gray without the color  and  possibly use the more colorful coat of arms  for the state links at botom of page  it s a thought  i grew up in vermont  i see you are from enlgand  what part  i am doing a signage and branding project in sevenoaks  kent at present best jim ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

2d5a9dd50fe2c6cf,  oops  i think i m seeing the issue and it is indeed my error somehow i missed that the epidemiology section had a second section regarding comorbidity in it i have struck my comment above  and in the future i won t mention it again unless it s relevant to acknolwedge my previous error my apologies  i would argue however that incidence which relates to new appearances of did in the community at large  isn t a good subheading because the section includes a discussion of both incidence and prevalence i suggest using a subheading with both incidence and prevalence though another option is simply leaving it as epidemiology the wp medmos diseases or disorders or syndromes doesn t give much guiance here bar noting that epidemiology should include incidence and prevalence information  no mention of subsections usually you leave it as a single larger section until it gets sufficiently lengthy that it makes sense to split them out  which is itself dependent on the sources i ve replaced the section heading  but both i and p the section overall needs fleshing out with more sources  which i think are unfortunately lacking searching on pubmed for did and both incidence and prevalence turns up no articles specifically focussed on either topic  t c  wikipedia s rules simple complex  again  my apologies for the error  the fault was completely mine  ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

5ced06e466fc0d37,  thanks for posting the notice in talk pri  tina i share h  s  nd s rational for opposing the move  despite the university of prishtina precedent  where i just don t dare to tread as discussed in talk pri  tina  i find that pristina is just a simplified version of pri  tina widely used because of mainly two factors  lack of in english  and most keyboards  and political neutrality  in fact  the very same people who write pristina pronounce the word with the sh sound  in my personal opinion  and in h  s  nd s words diacritics are  a more perfectionist and educative way to display  the name as for the official website  check the welcome to kosova section  not to mention the history section prishtina airport was officially opened and initially was opened for domestic flights only airport prishtina initially has begun its operations and other airport matters with employed workers in total  i can t stress enough that my opinion has nothing to do with taking sides in the current kosovo conflict  which i would solve by moving the entire population of the western balkans to antarctica  and giving the region to the penguins who probably will change pri  tina s official name to something in the lines of tekeli li best regards  ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

7ebd8162d07c807a,could you explain what explanation you think is missing from this article there are extensive wikilinks to articles on the details of the science  as you know ts  tony  links are generally bad when it is possible to give an explanation in the body of the article any science article should give a clear and coherent and succinct explanation of why scientists believe x  in this case  correct me if i m wrong the reasons why scientists believe the global warming hypothesis  namely the hypothesis that the earth is continuing to warm  and that the increase in temperature in the last years is not merely a random accident  are empirical evidence  the temperature record  which suggests that the increase is not merely a random accident  theoretical model  radiative forcing by anthropogenically introduced factors  co mainly theoretical model  feedback  as to what is missing  there is no explanation in the article about the statistics of temperature records  nor about the need  very important in science  to distinguish random fluctuations from changes caused by an underlying process  for example  current economic theory  the efficient market hypothesis holds that there are no such things as trends in stock markets the  trends  you see are just the result of humans trying to see patterns in events that are essentially random a lot of that theory involves careful definition of randomness  and types of randomness i don t see an equivalent section in this article  the explanation in the article of radiative forcing is somewhat better  but goes into unnecessary detail the section on greenhouse gases can t decide whether it is about the increase in co or the effect of that increase the stuff on aerosols and soot tends to confuse the whole thing that should be left to a sub article  the role of feedback is hardly explained at all that  i believe  is an important part of the hypothesis  yet the section discussing it is a strange list of things with no obvious purpose  there is no heading section that ties the three parts of the hypothesis together the section  climate models  is all rather uncertain it needs a summary at the beginning to explain what scientists conclude from their use of models  and perhaps some material on the uncertainty that is attached to models ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

d5758ab76f2c71b4, sweden the legal actions taken by the swedish royal family is according to the article in svd not for his comments about sweden in general  but for his comments about the royal family per se  and then especially his comments about princess madeleine claiming she being indecent  out of curiosity does anyone know what these creatures  i won t have them in the same category as us humans  at wbc make of the united nations  i can imagine they ll  hate  it  as they seem to  hate  everything in the universe  but it would be interesting to know i completely agree with the guy above me  but as this is an encyclopedia  why do we have to start an article about a schurch off with  hate  group perhaps because these are a group of people who rejoyce when thousands of children die in terrible tragedies and come to funerals to yell vial things at the loved ones of the people that fought for their rights  what the hell should we start it off with  this is a local church that has very good after school programs hatred of islam and muslims  however despicable  is not racism  and neither is hatred of catholics or catholicism in general the racism section is pretty weak there is plenty bad to be said about phelps without bringing the allegation that he uses the word  nigger nice work much better  i removed the npov tag  this article could be accused of not quite attaining npov  but it is clear that the writers have made an attempt to see this ridiculous crusade from both sides that is nothing short of heroic patrick beverley august former members of westboro baptist church  the article has been updated with the following george stutzman  theresa davis  chris davis  karl hockenbarger  bill hockenbarger and his wife  james hockenbarger and joshua phelps roper are no longer members of the westboro baptist church  where did this information come from  the hockenbargers have been members of the church for a long time  i believe chris davis is married to rebekah phelps davis  one of fred phelps  children  his leaving the church would mean that he and rebekah are no longer together  joshua is one of the children of church spokesperson shirley phelps roper  his leaving would probably mean that he no longer has a relationship with his parents as dorothea bird once said if you re in  you re in  if you re out  you re out hate  group  any chance of this article having a further early emphasis on it being a recognised  hate  group lies  the westboro baptist cult disgrace me  they  hate  catholics because they aparantly abuse children and are homo sex s  this is absolute lies and heavily offensive  the fact that they make up so much lies and how there actions are contradicted within the bible should be given more attention  anyone agree appearance  i remember an appearance by a woman and her children on the howard stern show  they were members of the westboro church  and in the few minutes i watched one thing that the woman said struck me as an interesting point i don t  hate faggot god  hate s  faggot or something to that effect and yes  fred phelps mentioned this subject in an april interview with blacktable com here s the url dec utc article structure i started some sections to give the article more structure  and made other indicated changes dec utc comment on a similar note  should we change references to this group from church to organization i understand the name is westboro baptist church  however for accuracy sake they are not really a church  this church praises dead swedes a friend gave me this  copy and paste this link in to your webbrowser otherwise it won t work http data  channel org p src gif i don t know of its validity  if somebody want to add this to the article  go ahead  if you can t download the image  it s basically a flier by the church that praises the presumed deaths of swedes in the recent asian tsunami  as a swedish citizen i find it highly offensive that goes beyond words  so it would be impossible for me to write an  unbiased addition to the article regarding this  thanks jan utc criticism section should be expanded further i added a bit to it,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
